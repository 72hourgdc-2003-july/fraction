    This game was created entirerly by me, John Sterling - "parklife", with c++/c in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, using Allegro for sound, graphics and keyboard routines. The art was made by me & Ironshanks.

    I you want to get a reach of me, send a mail to p4rklife@hotmail.com, or an ICQ message to UIN 3774564.

    Big thanks goes to:

    IronShanks, for his awesome enemy sprites.
    Nairb, for starting this competition.
    DB, for his excellent playtesting.
